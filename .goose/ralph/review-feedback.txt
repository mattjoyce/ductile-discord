CRITICAL ISSUES - WORK INCOMPLETE:

1. **RUFF ISSUES NOT FIXED**: 3 linting errors remain unfixed:
   - 2 unnecessary f-string prefixes (fixable with --fix)
   - 1 bare except clause that should specify exception types

2. **DEADCODE NOT PROPERLY RUN**: Dead code analysis shows 6 unused items, but worker failed to properly clean them up. Note: Some items like `on_ready`, `on_message` are Discord event handlers and should NOT be removed despite appearing "unused".

3. **DEPENDENCIES MISSING**: Virtual environment only has ruff/deadcode but code requires discord.py, click, requests, pyyaml. Code cannot run at all currently.

4. **WORK SUMMARY EMPTY**: work-summary.txt contains almost no information ("1:") - indicates incomplete process.

5. **NO COMPLETION FLAG**: Missing work-complete.txt file.

REQUIRED FIXES:
- Run `ruff check --fix` to auto-fix the 2 f-string issues
- Fix the bare except clause manually with specific exception types
- Install missing dependencies in the venv (discord.py, click, requests, pyyaml)
- Properly analyze deadcode output and only remove truly unused code (keep Discord event handlers)
- Create proper work summary documenting what was done
- Verify code actually runs without errors

The task was to make the code "ready for further development" but current state has broken dependencies and unfixed linting issues.
